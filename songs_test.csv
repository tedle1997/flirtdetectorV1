Say that it's always been me

Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest  
It turns out it ain't enough  
You're still not mentioning love  
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?  
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere  
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her  
And I think that I know things may never change  
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say  
  
I make you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue

How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
But, despite the truth that I know  
I find it hard to let go and give up on you  
Seems I love the things you do  
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am  
To persist with this heartbreak and running around  
And I will do until I'm finding myself you  
  
And make you feel a way you've never felt before  
And be all you need so that you never want more  
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue  
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

It's harder when you're on top  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
No room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love

"[Verse 1]  
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on  
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young  
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made  
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake  
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water, now that something's in me  
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
  
[Verse 2]  
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance  
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
It's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

You had my heart inside your hand  
But you played it with a beating  
  
Throw your soul through every open door  
Count your blessings to find what you look for  
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow  
  
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all  
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Without falling to your feet

Everybody loves the things you do  
From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know

Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless

It was just like a song

Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me

Everything just takes me back  
To when you were there  
To when you were there  
And a part of me keeps holding on  
Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?

Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey  
High up in the sun in the brightest sky  
Sun in the brightest sky

Only love is worth the chase  
All my love, I know we're waiting for this  
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

All my love  
All my love  
All my love

With violent words and empty threats  
And it's sick that all these battles

I got one more problem with you girl  
Aye

Hey baby, even though I hate ya  
I wanna love ya, I want you  
And even though I can't forgive ya  
I really want ya, I want you  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
Why can't ya leave me?  
Cause even though I shouldn't want it  
I gotta have it, I want you  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Head in the clouds  
Got no weight on my shoulders  
I should be wiser  
And realize that i've got

One less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less, one less problem  
  
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]  
I know you're never gonna wake up  
I gotta give up, but it's you?  
I know I shouldn't ever call back  
Or let you come back, but it's you  
Every time you touch me  
And say you love me  
I get a little bit breathless  
I shouldn't want it, but it's you

Got no weight on my shoulders  
I should be wiser

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]  
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you  
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you  
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you  
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you  
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'  
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you than I love your presence  
And the best thing now is prolly for you to exit  
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson  
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'  
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'  
There's a million you's baby boy, so don't be dumb  
I got 99 problems but you won't be one  
Like what!

One less, one less problem  
One less, one less problem

Might feel a little drunk  
And if you try to leave me  
I'll lock you in the trunk  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you  
My voodoo's so addicting  
3 silver spoons of brandy wine  
Just a frog and a little thyme and  
Baby you'll be mine  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
  
Verse 2:  
Boy I really knew you were the one  
The moment that I saw your eyes  
Mmm hmmm  
Strong and wise and sweet and quiet  
Yeah you're just my type  
Mmm hmmm  
  
Pre 2:  
Now I'm not talkin' bout movies  
Don't need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And be my shiny prince  
I'm just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little high  
But we'll be so enchanted  
And you'll feel so alive

Just what I want  
And boy I really want you now

And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.

Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely life.  
Lonely days and nights (away from you).  
We can live our life

With our separate lives.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Lonely days and nights.

We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Suddenly, all the world gets in the way  
You disappear into the crowd  
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud  
I want to know you , but I never met you  
Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong, only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Living your life in someone else's heart  
A lover's dream that has no end  
There may be somebody you can base your world upon  
I'll never be the same again  
And there's a part of me here  
And there's a part of me with you  
But all of me loves you  
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me  
I'm so proud of  
All of my days I will be here for you  
And the love keeps running  
And if I can't hold you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons

But winter always came around and made the growing way too hard

She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see

With a rose that she saved inside

"Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, ""Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
""Might be snakes there in that grass""
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her,
She'd say ""Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus hands""
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, ""Matty don' you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core""
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for

"Well you're magic he said 
But don't let it all go to your head 
'Cause I bet if you all had it all figured out 
Then you'd never get out of bed 
Well, no doubt 
Of all the thing's that I've read what he wrote me 
It's now sounding like the man I was hoping 
To be 
I keep on keeping it real 
'Cause it keeps getting easier he'll see 
He's the reason that I'm laughing 
Even if there's no one else 
He said, you've got to love yourself
You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak 
But keep your tongue up in your cheek 
And if you stumble on to something better 
Remember that it's humble that you seek 
You got all the skill you need
Individuality 
You got something 
They call it gumption 
They call it anything you want 
Because when you play the fool now 
You're only fooling everyone else 
You're learning to love yourself
Yes you are, you are, yes you, you, you
And there's no price to pay, no, no
When you're givin' what you take 
That's why it's easy to thank you 
You, you
You, you, you
Let's say you take a break from our day 
And gettin' back to the old garage 
Because life's too short anyway 
But at least it's better then average 
As long as you got me 
And I got yo, you know we'll got a lot to go around 
I'll be your friend, your other brother 
Another love to come and comfort you
And I'll keep reminding 
If it's the only thing I ever do 
I will always love you
You, you, you 
You

"And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn twenty five
I keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same
But when we leave this year, we won't be coming back
No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day
Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
And I keep thinking of that night in June
I didn't know much of love
But it came too soon
And there was me and you
And then we got real cool
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels
As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever
So if we get the big jobs
And we make the big money
When we look back now
Will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school
Still be trying to break every single rule?
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
And this is how it feels
As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever
La, la, la, la
Yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la
We will still be friends forever
Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there?
Can we make it somehow (somehow)?
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be

Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra

You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it

Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle

Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes

Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl

As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""

Need a vacation, I'll send you a card  
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii  
It's so exciting, why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
I've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

And the fireworks are through  
Here we are, me and you  
Feeling lost and feeling blue  
It's the end of the party  
And the morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now's the time for us to say  
  
Happy New Year

May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year

May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Sometimes I see  
How the brave new world arrives  
And I see how it thrives  
In the ashes of our lives  
Oh yes, man is a fool  
And he thinks he'll be okay  
Dragging on, feet of clay  
Never knowing he's astray  
Keeps on going anyway

If we don't we might as well lay down and die

That the dreams we had before  
Are all dead, nothing more  
Than confetti on the floor  
It's the end of a decade  
In another ten years time  
Who can say what we'll find  
What lies waiting down the line  
In the end of eighty-nine

Of a world where every neighbor is a friend

And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above

Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

And I have to sit down for a while

And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know

I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me.

I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too  
Does the feeling seem oh so right  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I can't hold on  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Heaven and earth, you and I  
A world we will always be  
Here in the silence we lie  
Shadows we cast, you and I  
Speak for eternity

With every word that I hear  
Whenever whispers are near  
I can believe in fate  
Promises made, only one  
  
Yesterday fades from the sun  
And falls to a new embrace  
Years overflow  
As rivers run dry  
  
Here in a moment of time passing by  
You and I will always be, will always be

"They were married in September back in 1969  
They travelled, these two Indians,  
To find some peace of mind  
They stood for love and freedom  
They were children of their time oh oh  
  
They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring  
They swore they would change it  
with loving and shareing  
They'll never live like their parents have done  
Their innocence shone like the sun  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills  
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills  
And she has trouble sleeping  
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh  
  
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers  
Now they've got nothing to say to each other  
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes  
They filed for divorce and it breaks their  
  
American hearts, so fiIled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Ah - American hearts  
Ah - American hearts, American hearts  
  
Now that it's over they'll each go on living  
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving  
They'll care for their children protect them with pride  
And that's how their dream will survive in

Nothing to surround me

And the fans all go insane.

Players dash,  
With skates a-flash,  
The home team trails behind.  
But they grab the puck,  
And go bursting up,  
And they're down across the line.  
They storm the crease,  
Like bumblebees,  
They travel like a burning flame.  
See them slide the puck inside,  
It's a one one hockey game!

Face off down the rink,  
And the Stanley Cup,  
Is all filled up,  
For the champs who win the drink!  
Now the final flick,  
Of a hockey stick,  
And a one gigantic scream:

I'm punk hear me roar! I'm gonna break my guitar  
Now watch me as I sing my song

They are really popish songs but soon they will be punk

Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real  
Now I'm trapped in this memory  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
So even though you're close to me  
You're still so distant  
And I can't bring you back

Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories

I'm with you

Watch and wait I'll tell you off,  
Not with any words,  
No, no, no, no, no,  
So listen up, this is goin' great,  
Why you gotta step in and tell me it aint too late,  
I'm like whoa! Who would still go for somebody,  
Who's already messed you up, You askin for it again,  
And I ain't afraid,  
No I'm not,

I want you to go,  
Just causin' more trouble as you flow,  
Not gonna happen to me again,  
Boy, there's no way, that I'll fall for you again, cause I'll go,  
Go outta my mind,  
Go completely crazy,  
If you don't think I will just think again,  
No way that I'll put up with this,  
I'll let you go,  
From my mind,  
Go straight on, and continue with my life  
Just go, and forget about you,  
I don't need you,  
No, no  
Watch and wait, you'll go crazy,  
Without seein' me,  
Just go!  
  
You'll see me in whole different way,  
Not talkin' to you, I have nothing to say,  
Nothing at all,  
You're the cause of all my pain,  
And I say to myself,  
'Girl you went crazy before,  
I won't let you go crazy again, again, '  
Why is this day goin' so slow,  
Come on, what's that saign?  
Oh yeah,  
You'll never forget me, even if it's the last thing you do!

"""Anything But Ordinary""  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh myself to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
Sometimes I drive so fast  
Just to feel the danger  
I wanna scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive

"[Verse:]  
When I heard that you'd died  
I was stabbed inside  
I'll never be the same again  
I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend  
Even though I never knew you  
From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you  
And your life lost, so young, so new  
And you never realised  
That so many would lose their sleep tonight

So don't tell me  
Not to cry  
'cause I'm hurting  
Inside, outside  
Young girl, you're to young to die  
I heard your ambition's high  
Now look me in the eye  
And tell me that I shouldn't cry  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I was there from the start  
When I heard, I gave my heart  
I can't connect how I feel  
With what happened, or what's real  
You felt the fear and then the blow  
You couldn't say goodbye before you go  
I can't sweep aside what I feel  
I can't sweep aside, it's so real  
The cruel world let you die  
So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry  
I was choked up inside  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm feeling like I've got no right  
When there's others who won't sleep for nights  
I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way  
But I can't hold it back another day  
These tears, this song's for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To let you know I care  
But a stab to my heart unprepared  
Left me feeling outta life  
The day that you died

I'll never get over it

If I could say what I want to say  
I'd say I want to blow you, away  
Be with you every night  
  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
  
Marry me today  
Guess I'm wishing my life away  
With these things I'll never say  
These things I'll never say

Girl I'd do anything for one more chance,  
Cause I want you back again

When you close your eyes do you think about me?  
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're all that I see.  
  
You and I we shared enough together  
Each other was all we'd ever need  
I thought that you would stay with me forever  
But I took for granted the love you gave to me  
But I'll keep on trying, till the end  
Baby I need you back with me

Until you let me come back to you  
  
I think about you girl every time at night  
I'm in love, and it feels so right  
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain  
I was just caught up in the lying game  
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways  
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days  
Until you let me come back,  
Until you let me start

To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain

At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself

She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise

She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

Right alongside the rich and famous

We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now

Did someone else steal my part?

Because my heart is weak and worn  
So won't you please be careful I'm fragile  
I can't imagine the damage  
I'll have to handle  
If you hurt me one more time  
Please be mine

That I can depend on

That I'm your sweetheart...  
Hey someone that you can depend on...

Can't you see?  
Girl, you know with me  
Is where you should be  
And if by chance we should find  
That it can be for you and I  
Then girl I'll try  
I'll try  
Oh baby

Girl, you should know how I feel by now  
There's so many ways to love  
So just open your heart  
And I'll find the way

Love is lost in the equation  
Wondering why there is still so many wars

A world of devestation  
No one knowing where it's gonna go  
We got too many too hungry  
It's time to stop this suffering  
And I don't think we can do it on our own

To save our souls

Overflow our hearts with kindness  
Help us lift the clouds out of our way

I guess you were lost when I met you  
Still there were tears in your eyes  
So out of trust and I knew  
No more than mysteries and lies  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night

Who will make all your sorrows undone  
I'll be the light  
When you feel like there's nowhere to run  
I'll be the one...  
  
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright  
'Cause my faith is gone  
And I want to take you from darkness to light  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night

We can share our dreams comin' true  
I can show you what true love means  
Just take my hand, baby please

Go to ""the docks"" and check out ""bsb fanzine - online"" to listen to the song.

Are mending on the shelf  
I saw you  
Holding hands  
Standing close to someone else  
Now I sit all alone  
Wishin' all my feeling was gone  
Gotta get over you  
Nothing for me to do  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
This time  
Stop living a lie  
  
I know I got to be strong,  
But around me  
Life goes on  
And on  
And on  
And on  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes  
Right after I have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
For the very last time  
Quit living a lie

I got to hold you, head on my shoulder  
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I  
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent  
  
Every single night like its 25 to life  
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven  
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call

I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
First time it rings  
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you  
That moment I knew  
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice  
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

I been doing a lot of thinking lately  
Am I over her?

It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days  
Since the last time I seen your pretty face  
My decision to bring this to an end  
And I'm caught up in reminscing  
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks  
Play fights, late nights  
It's been on my mind since Valentine's  
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide

Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain  
Now my situation's taking a big change  
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town  
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around  
Is she sad or is she mad?  
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?  
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on  
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone

Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
It's water under the bridge  
But I can't seem to forget  
All the plans we made, all the time we spent  
Makes me reminisce  
I still see your face  
All this love I can't replace

When it's dark  
In the lights

A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
I looked down  
And my shirt's turning red  
I'm spinning around  
Felt her lips on my neck  
And her voice  
In my ear  
Like I missed you  
Want you tonight

Straight through my heart  
A single bullet got me  
I can't stop the bleeding  
Oh oh  
Straight through my heart  
She aimed and she shot me  
I just can't believe it  
Oh oh  
No I can't resist  
And I can't be hit  
I just can't escape this love  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
  
Thought I moved  
More than on  
Thought I could  
Fool her charm  
I really wanna go  
But I can't leave her alone  
Oh oh  
  
Hear the sound  
Of a love so loud  
I just can't  
I just can't  
Ignore this feeling  
Said she missed me  
And she wants me  
Wants me tonight

Of the night  
When it's dark  
In the lights

Is a mystery to us all  
No one can predict the wheel of fortune  
As it falls

Oh tidings of comfort and joy

And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name

To free all those who trust in him

Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay

When I see you dancing  
When it comes to dancing  
My body keeps changing my mind  
You, it's you in my heart  
It's you on my mind  
And you just can't help it  
I should give it some time  
And wait for the right sign  
That you want me  
'Cause  
  
Repeat (chorus )  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
And we fly together across the floor  
My heart's crying out for more  
Cause I just can't resist you  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
You know  
  
Repeat (chorus)

Now that I have your hand to hold  
The winds might blow through me  
But I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there  
  
And now, now when we touch  
My feelings slide  
Now when I'm smiling, I know why  
You light up my world like the morning sun  
You're so deep within me we're almost one  
And now all the feelings that I have start to fade  
I was always afraid life might forget me  
Love might let me down  
Then look who I found  
  
(The winds might blow through me, but I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there)  
  
And now, now when I wake, there's someone home  
I'll never face the night alone  
You gave me the courage I need to win  
To open my heart and to let you in

Until now  
  
No, I never really knew how until now

It is the night of the dear Saviors birth  
  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
  
So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men from the Orient land  
  
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
  
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger  
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend  
Behold your King, your King, before Him lowly bend  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His Gospel is Peace  
  
Chains shall He break for the slave Is our brother  
And in his name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we.  
Let all within us praise His holy Name  
  
Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
His power and glory evermore proclaim

Took me somewhere I had never been,  
And I want to live again, breath again  
In the shelter of his brightly woven love song.

Now my waiting here is free.  
  
Few are the choices we are given,  
The sand of time pass quickly by.

Now I can't help but believe  
That my whole life will be spent in one love.

And you walk through the doors  
It's the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile  
Try and stay out of everybody's way  
  
It's your freshman year  
And you're gonna be here for the next four years  
In this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys  
Will wink at you and say, ""you know I haven't seen you around, before""

Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen

Count to ten  
Take it in  
This is life before you know who you're gonna be  
At fifteen  
  
You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail  
And soon enough you're best friends  
Laughing at the other girls  
Who they think they're so cool  
We'll be out of here as soon as we can  
  
And then you're on your very first date  
And he's got a car  
And you're feeling like flying  
And you're mama's waiting up  
And you're thinking he's the one  
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
And your first kiss makes your head spin around  
  
But in your life you'll do things  
Greater than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had  
To a boy who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Don't forget to look before you fall  
  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen

That you'll stand by me forever  
But if God forbid fate should step in  
And force us into a goodbye

When they point to the pictures

Tell them how the crowds went wild  
Tell them how I hope they shine

When I met you on the outskirts of town  
  
And I said  
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""  
  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story, baby just say yes""  
  
Oh, oh,  
Oh, oh  
  
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded  
You, picking on the weaker man  
  
You can take me down  
With just one single blow  
But you don't know what you don't know  
  
Someday I'll be living in a big old city  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation  
You have pointed out my flaws again  
As if I don't already see them  
I walk with my head down,  
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you  
I just want to feel okay again

Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now

Talking over a football game  
With that same big loud opinion  
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting  
About the same old bitter things  
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing  
But all you are is mean  
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic  
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean  
  
But someday I'll be living in a big old city  
And all you're ever gonna be is mean  
Yeah someday I'll be big enough  
So you can't hit me

But something about it felt like home somehow  
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house  
And you still got it in your drawer, even now  
  
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze  
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay  
But I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me  
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team  
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And there's nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to

We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well  
  
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah  
  
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find

But I don't wanna have to go that far  
And I, I've got you down  
I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
And don't wait for the sky to clear

Screamed your name

"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps,  
Praying the floor won't fall through, again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind,  
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game,  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ""run as fast as you
can""  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home  
  
Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong  
Don't you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?  
I should've known  
  
You are an expert at sorry,  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry  
Have tired, lifeless eyes  
'Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,  
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.  
  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You should've known, you should've known  
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known

Same old tired, lonely place  
Walls of insincerity  
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""  
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy  
And it was enchanting to meet you

I wonder till I'm wide awake

I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This is me praying that this was the very first page  
Not where the story line ends  
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again  
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
Please don't be in love with someone else

This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes  
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart  
Maybe this year  
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special  
  
'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
And last Christmas  
And this year  
It won't be anything like, anything like  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special

"Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables  
Left a small town, never looked back  
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'  
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts  
  
I say, ""can you believe it?""  
As we're lyin' on the couch  
The moment, I can see it  
Yes, yes, I can see it now  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together  
And there's a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded  
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  
  
And we got bills to pay  
We got nothin' figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes, yes  
This is what I thought about  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?  
You put your arm around me, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  
You saw me start to believe, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.  
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands  
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street  
  
Braced myself for the goodbye,  
'Cause that's all I've ever known  
Then, you took me by surprise  
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""  
  
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.  
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.  
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.  
She is the best thing that's ever been mine.""  
  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you believe it?  
We're gonna make it now  
And I can see it  
  
(I can see it now)

"Your little hands wrapped around my finger  
And it's so quiet in the world tonight  
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming  
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight  
  
To you, everything's funny  
You got nothing to regret  
I'd give all I have honey  
If you could stay like that  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
No one will desert you  
Just try to never grow up  
Never grow up  
  
You're in the car on the way to the movies  
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off  
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do  
And you can't wait to move out  
Someday and call your own shots  
  
But don't make her drop you off around the block  
Remember that she's getting older too  
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for
school  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
And no one's ever burned you  
Nothing's ever left you scarred  
And even though you want to  
Just try to never grow up  
  
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room  
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home  
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said  
And all your little brother's favorite songs  
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone  
  
So here I am in my new apartment  
In a big city, they just dropped me off  
It's so much colder than I thought it would be  
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on  
  
Wish I'd never grown up  
I wish I'd never grown up  
Oh I don't wanna grow up  
Wish I'd never grown up  
Could still be little  
Oh I don't wanna grow up  
Wish I'd never grown up  
It could still be simple  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to  
Please try to never grow up  
Don't you ever grow up

"(Spoken):  
My name's Taylor Swift  
This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you  
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra  
And its the song called Our Last Night  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.  
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar  
I hope the world never tore that out of you  
Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played, and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
Oh oh yeah  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
On our last night  
Oh oh oh oh oh

He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""  
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""  
And he said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day  
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice all the roses  
And the note that said,

And when I got home, before I said amen

Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song

Sneaking out late, tapping on his window

"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Loving him was red  
  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front
of you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that
strong  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible

Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
'Cause loving him was red  
Yeah, yeah red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  
Comes back to me, burning red  
Yeah, yeah

Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up

You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Come on baby with me

Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And it's about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital  
We'll just disappear  
Come on baby with me

What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

I've never heard silence quite this loud

In a crowded room  
And we're not speaking

Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say

When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
The battle's in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
Now I'm standing alone

"New to town with a made up name in the angel city, chasing fortune and fame  
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream  
You had it figured out since you were in school  
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool  
So over night, you look like a sixties queen  
Another name goes up in lights  
Like diamonds in the sky  
  
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views  
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you  
And your secrets end up, splashed on the news front page  
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused  
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used  
And all the young things line up to take your place  
Another name goes up in lights  
You wonder if you'll make it out alive  
  
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
It was a few years later, I showed up here  
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared  
They took the money and your dignity and got the hell out  
  
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere  
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square  
And it took some time but I understand it now  
'Cause now my name is up in lights  
But I think you got it right  
  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one

"You should've been there,  
Should've burst through the door,  
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,  
And it would've felt like,  
A million little shining stars had just aligned,  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
Christmas lights glisten,  
I've got my eye on the door,  
Just waiting for you to walk in,  
But the time is ticking,  
People ask me how I've been  
As I comb back through my memory,  
How you said you'd be here,  
You said you'd be here.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
As I'm looking around the room,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
And the hours pass by,  
Now I just wanna be alone,  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When there's something really wrong,  
So they follow me down the hall,  
And there in the bathroom,  
I try not to fall apart,  
And the sinking feeling starts,  
As I say hopelessly,  
""He said he'd be here.""  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,

But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know?  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didn't show?  
  
You should've been here.  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all standing around me singing  
""Happy birthday to you"",  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
Ooh, I knew.  
Ooh,  
  
You called me later,  
And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,""  
And I said, ""I'm sorry too,""  
And that was the moment I knew.

Ignoring words that you were saying  
Trying to make me stay  
I said, 'This time I've had enough'  
And you've called a hundred times  
But I'm not picking up  
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs  
Staring at the phone  
I keep going back over, things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldn't see  
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
And I'll scream out the window  
I can't even look at you  
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do  
I say, 'there's nothing you can say  
To make this right again'  
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I  
  
I said leave but baby all I want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carried me from your car up the stairs  
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess, I need you

And he says you look beautiful tonight  
And I feel perfectly fine

And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name  
You're so in love that you act insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breakin' down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much

And never makes me wait  
And he calls exactly when he says he will  
He's close to my mother  
Talks business with my father  
He's charming and endearing  
And I'm comfortable

Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said: ""That's a lie.""  
Just a boy in a Chevy truck

On back roads at night  
And I was right there beside him all summer long

The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think ""that little black dress""  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
September saw a month of tears  
And thankin' God that you weren't here  
To see me like that  
But in a box beneath my bed  
Is a letter that you never read  
From three summers back  
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet  
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

I'm standin' on your street  
And there's a letter left on your doorstep  
And the first thing that you'll read  
  
Is when you think ""Tim McGraw""  
I hope you think my favorite song  
Someday you'll turn your radio on  
I hope it takes you back to that place
